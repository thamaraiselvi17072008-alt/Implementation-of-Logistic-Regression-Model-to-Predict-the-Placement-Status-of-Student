# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Load the placement dataset and remove unnecessary columns such as serial number and salary.

2.Convert all categorical attributes into numerical values using label encoding.

3.Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train–test split.

4.Train a Logistic Regression model using the training data. 5.Predict placement status and evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

    'Hours_Studied': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    'Previous_Score': [40, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80],
    'Internship': [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # 0 = No, 1 = Yes
    'Placement': [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]    # Target: 0 = Not Placed, 1 = Placed
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df[['Hours_Studied', 'Previous_Score', 'Internship']]
y = df['Placement']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nAccuracy Score:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
new_student = np.array([[6, 68, 1]])  # Example: 6 hours studied, 68 prev score, Internship yes
new_student_scaled = scaler.transform(new_student)
placement_pred = model.predict(new_student_scaled)
placement_prob = model.predict_proba(new_student_scaled)
print(f"\nPredicted Placement Status: {'Placed' if placement_pred[0]==1 else 'Not Placed'}")
print(f"Probability of Placement: {placement_prob[0][1]:.2f}")
